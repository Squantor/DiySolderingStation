# Soldering iron connector plates
It can be a pain in the ass to modify a case with drill and nibbling tool to exactly fit a bunch of connectors, so these plates will make this job a bit easier. 3d print the plate, screw in your connectors and screw in the plate.
There are three relevant connectors that this project uses. The T245 handle connector, the T115 connector and the Stand connector. This directory contains a few variants that I use. Feel free to make your own as you see fit.
