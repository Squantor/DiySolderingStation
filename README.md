# DIY soldering station
This are plans for a DIY (Do it yourself) soldering station. I have currently have a JBC soldering station that I absolutely love but it lacks features, I can shell out the money for a more advanced one but I am also interesting in building one of my own, to my own specifications.
## Requirements
* Supports multiple power outputs
* Supports most JBC hardware like stands, irons, tips
* Supports controllable outputs for turning on pumps when the iron is removed
## Directory structure
* Hardware contains the schematics and PCB's used by the project
* Software contains the software needed for the project, either embedded or PC side software
* CAD contains drawings of casing/mechanisms etc
## Checking out
This project makes extensive use of submodules, use ```git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Squantor/DiySolderingStation.git``` to clone the repository and its submodules in one go.
